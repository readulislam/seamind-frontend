    "metasGoalCardDes1":"Portugal must face climate change, environmental protection and biodiversity conservation as key challenges for the future. This recognition goes through a commitment to science and technological solutions that allow preventing impacts on ecosystems and developing regenerative solutions.",
    "metasGoalCardDes2":"Carbon neutrality is one of the country's great challenges for the coming years. With a commitment to oceanic renewable energies, favoring blue carbon, and encouraging processes with a smaller carbon footprint, the Sea can make a decisive contribution to this goal.",

    "metasGoalCardDes4":"Sustainable and sustainable food starts from the sustainable exploitation of living marine resources, the development of aquaculture and zero waste in processing. It is important to monitor pollutants, combat the fraudulent substitution of species and seek greater autonomy in the supply of the food chain.",
    "metasGoalCardDes5":"The increasing consumption of water in different uses puts great pressure on global water resources. In Portugal, with scenarios of prolonged drought, this pressure can get worse and it becomes essential to look for alternative sources of water and promote its efficient use.",
    "metasGoalCardDes6":"From marine ecosystems that provide oxygen and sequester carbon dioxide, through food and recreational opportunities, to bioactive substances from marine organisms with application in pharmaceuticals and beyond, the Ocean is closely linked to human health.",
    "metasGoalCardDes7":"The production of scientific knowledge to support public policies on the Sea must be a priority. It is important to retain and attract talent and investment to Portugal and to enhance our science internationally, promoting collaborative environments with potential for innovation.",
    "metasGoalCardDes8":"The next decade should help Portugal reinforce its investment in Ocean Literacy and improve its educational and training offer for all areas connected to the sea. Entrepreneurship, innovation, specialization, professional mobility and new skills must be encouraged.",
    "metasGoalCardDes9":"In both traditional and emerging sectors, the economy of the sea must play a decisive role in the country's re-industrialization, based on a modern logic that is inclusive, integrating R&D, efficient, respectful of environmental criteria and based on a circular economy.",
    "metasGoalCardDes10":"Due to its Atlantic and European dimension, Portugal must promote the implementation of an Integrated Maritime Policy in all aspects, consolidating international cooperation, guaranteeing sovereignty in its maritime area, and security in areas of national and international interest.",
